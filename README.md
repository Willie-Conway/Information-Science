# 🖥️ Information Science Projects Portfolio  
**B.S. in Computer Science & Information Science – Park University**  
👨🏿‍💻 Curated by Willie Conway

This repository showcases practical system administration, Linux programming, cloud infrastructure, and server management projects completed as part of my Information Science curriculum. Built across real environments like Google Cloud Platform and Linux, these projects demonstrate my skills in system configuration, automation, scripting, and server deployment.
